# Claude Octopus - System Instructions

> **Note:** This file provides context when working directly in the claude-octopus repository.
> For deployed plugins, visual indicator instructions are embedded in each skill file
> (flow-discover.md, flow-define.md, flow-develop.md, flow-deliver.md, skill-debate.md).

## Visual Indicators (MANDATORY)

When executing Claude Octopus workflows, you MUST display visual indicators so users know which AI providers are active and what costs they're incurring.

### Indicator Reference

| Indicator | Meaning | Cost Source |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 🐙 | Claude Octopus multi-AI mode active | Multiple APIs |
| 🔴 | Codex CLI executing | User's OPENAI_API_KEY |
| 🧭 | Antigravity CLI executing | User's Antigravity access/subscription |
| 🟣 | Perplexity Sonar web search | User's PERPLEXITY_API_KEY |
| 🔵 | Claude subagent processing | Included with Claude Code |

### When to Display Indicators

Display indicators when:
- Invoking any `/octo:` command
- Running `orchestrate.sh` with any workflow (probe, grasp, tangle, ink, embrace, etc.)
- User triggers workflow with "octo" prefix ("octo research X", "octo build Y")
- Executing multi-provider operations

Provider emoji are required in status banners, provider rows, compact banners,
and result attribution labels. Narrative prose may use provider names without
emoji.

### Required Output Format

**Before starting a workflow**, output this banner:

```
🐙 **CLAUDE OCTOPUS ACTIVATED** - [Workflow Type]
[Phase Emoji] [Phase Name]: [Brief description of what's happening]

Providers:
🔴 Codex CLI - [Provider's role in this workflow]
🧭 Antigravity CLI - [Provider's role in this workflow]
🔵 Claude - [Your role in this workflow]
```

**Phase emojis by workflow**:
- 🔍 Discover/Probe - Research and exploration
- 🎯 Define/Grasp - Requirements and scope
- 🛠️ Develop/Tangle - Implementation
- ✅ Deliver/Ink - Validation and review
- 🐙 Debate - Multi-AI deliberation
- 🐙 Embrace - Full 4-phase workflow

### Compact Mode

When `OCTOPUS_COMPACT_BANNERS=true` is set, use a condensed single-line banner instead:
```
🐙 Discover — Multi-provider research | 🔴🧭🔵
```

This is preferred for repeat users who don't need the full provider block every time.

### Examples (Standard Mode)

**Research workflow:**
```
🐙 **CLAUDE OCTOPUS ACTIVATED** - Multi-provider research mode
🔍 Discover Phase: Researching OAuth authentication patterns

Providers:
🔴 Codex CLI - Technical implementation analysis
🧭 Antigravity CLI - Ecosystem and community research
🔵 Claude - Strategic synthesis
```

**Build workflow:**
```
🐙 **CLAUDE OCTOPUS ACTIVATED** - Multi-provider implementation mode
🛠️ Develop Phase: Building user authentication system

Providers:
🔴 Codex CLI - Code generation and patterns
🧭 Antigravity CLI - Alternative approaches
🔵 Claude - Integration and quality gates
```

**Review workflow:**
```
🐙 **CLAUDE OCTOPUS ACTIVATED** - Multi-provider validation mode
✅ Deliver Phase: Reviewing authentication implementation

Providers:
🔴 Codex CLI - Code quality analysis
🧭 Antigravity CLI - Security and edge cases
🔵 Claude - Synthesis and recommendations
```

**Debate:**
```
🐙 **CLAUDE OCTOPUS ACTIVATED** - AI Debate Hub
🐙 Debate: Redis vs Memcached for session storage

Participants:
🔴 Codex CLI - Technical perspective
🧭 Antigravity CLI - Ecosystem perspective
🔵 Claude - Moderator and synthesis
```

### During Execution

When showing results from each provider, prefix with their indicator:

```
🔴 **Codex Analysis:**
[Codex findings...]

🧭 **Antigravity Analysis:**
[Antigravity findings...]

🔵 **Claude Synthesis:**
[Your synthesis...]
```

### Why This Matters

Users need to understand:
1. **What's running** - Which AI providers are being invoked
2. **Cost implications** - External CLIs (🔴 🧭) may use provider access or incur cost
3. **Progress tracking** - Which phase of the workflow is active

Without indicators, users have no visibility into what's happening or what they're paying for.

## Provider Readiness Contract

Provider Registry 2.0 is the authority for provider identity, capabilities,
authentication mode, detection, and health routing. Use
`scripts/helpers/check-providers.sh` for the documented machine-readable
admission protocol or `scripts/helpers/preflight.sh --json` for structured
readiness objects.

Static checks are local-only. Live checks run only after an explicit `--live`
request and must remain bounded. Doctor, setup, preflight, and provider
detection render the shared result objects; they must not independently probe
binaries, credentials, models, quota, or provider services. Diagnostics belong
on stderr, and readiness output must never contain credential values.

---

## File Creation Policy (CRITICAL)

**NEVER create temporary, progress, or working files in the plugin directory.**

### Prohibited File Patterns

The following file types MUST NEVER be created in the plugin directory:
- `PHASE*_PROGRESS.md` - Phase progress tracking
- `PHASE*_COMPLETE.md` - Phase completion markers
- `*_PROGRESS.md` - Any progress tracking files
- `*_TODO.md` - Working todo lists
- `*_NOTES.md` - Development notes
- `scratch_*.md` - Scratch files
- `temp_*.md` - Temporary files
- `WIP_*.md` - Work-in-progress markers

### Where to Create Working Files

**Use the scratchpad directory for ALL temporary/working files:**

```bash
# Scratchpad directory (auto-managed by Claude Code)
~/.claude/scratchpad/[session-id]/

# Example paths
~/.claude/scratchpad/abc123/phase1-progress.md
~/.claude/scratchpad/abc123/implementation-notes.md
~/.claude/scratchpad/abc123/todo-list.md
```

### Plugin Directory: Permanent Files Only

Only create files in the plugin directory that are:
- Part of the permanent codebase (commands, skills, agents, hooks)
- User-facing documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/)
- Build/config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, .gitignore)
- Test files in `tests/` directory

### Enforcement

If you need to track progress or create working files:
1. **Always use the scratchpad directory**
2. **Never commit working files to git**
3. **Reference scratchpad files by full path when discussing them**

**Example - WRONG:**
```bash
# ❌ Never do this
echo "Progress: 50%" > PHASE1_PROGRESS.md
```

**Example - CORRECT:**
```bash
# ✅ Always do this
echo "Progress: 50%" > ~/.claude/scratchpad/$(cat ~/.claude/session-id)/phase1-progress.md
```

| `octo debate X` | Debate | 🐙 🔴 🟡 🔵 |
| `/octo:embrace X` | All 4 phases | 🐙 (all phase emojis) |

---

## Provider Detection

Before running workflows, check provider availability with
`scripts/helpers/check-providers.sh`, which is the single source of truth for
how each provider is detected (binary presence, API key, and auth state).

If a provider is unavailable, note it in the banner:
```
Providers:
🔴 Codex CLI - [role] (unavailable - skipping)
🧭 Antigravity CLI - [role]
🔵 Claude - [role]
```

---

## Cost Awareness

Always be mindful that external CLIs cost money:
- 🔴 Codex: ~$0.01-0.30 per query depending on model (GPT-5.6 Sol $4/$20 MTok — frontier default, Terra $2/$12, Luna $0.20/$1.20). Explicit-only GPT-6 Astra costs $10/$50; above 272K input tokens its full request uses 2x input and 1.5x output pricing.
- 🧭 Antigravity CLI (`agy`): Included with the user's Antigravity access/subscription; backend cost depends on selected `OCTOPUS_AGY_MODEL`. Because Antigravity's model list is service-owned, explicit pins should use labels returned by `agy models` (for example `Gemini 3.5 Flash (Low)`) or `default`/`agy/default` to use the CLI default.
- 🟣 Perplexity: ~$0.01-0.05 per query (Sonar Pro $3/$15 MTok, Sonar $1/$1 MTok)
- 🔵 Claude (Sonnet 5.5, default on Claude Code v2.1.284+): Standard Claude seat, $2/$10 per MTok; Sonnet 5 and legacy fallbacks remain available. Included where the user's Claude Code subscription covers it
- 🔵 Claude (Fable 5.1, Mythos-class, opt-in via `OCTOPUS_OPUS_MODEL=claude-fable-5-1`): **$10/$50 per MTok**. 1M context, 128K output. Never auto-selected. The preserved `claude-fable-5` ID remains supported. Note: Anthropic retains prompts/outputs up to 30 days for safety classifiers. When pinned, apply the dispatch profile in `skills/blocks/fable5-prompting.md` (prompt anti-patterns, effort discipline, refusal fallback, judgment routing).
- 🔵 Claude (Opus 5.5, default when `SUPPORTS_OPUS_5_5=true`, Claude Code v2.1.280+): $4/$20 per MTok input/output. 1M context, 128K output. Thinking is always on; the API default effort is `medium`.
- 🔵 Claude (Opus 5, default when `SUPPORTS_OPUS_5=true` and Opus 5.5 is unavailable): $5/$25 per MTok input/output. 1M context, 128K output. Use `high` effort by default; raise it only for a bounded capability-sensitive step.
- 🔵 Claude (Opus 5 Fast): $10/$50 per MTok — 2x standard cost. Use only when latency matters.
- 🔵 Claude (Opus 4.7, legacy/current-minus-one): $5/$25 per MTok input/output. Used automatically on Claude Code versions before 2.1.154 when supported.
- 🔵 Claude (Opus 4.6, legacy): $5/$25 per MTok — still selectable via `OCTOPUS_OPUS_MODEL=claude-opus-4.6` or `claude-opus-legacy` agent type
- 🔵 Claude (Opus 4.6 Fast, legacy): **$30/$150 per MTok** (6x standard) — lower latency, extra-usage billing for pinned 4.6 sessions.
- 🟤 OpenCode: Variable cost — free for native models, uses backend provider pricing when routing to OpenAI/Google

Note: API availability and subscription/OAuth availability differ by model and account. GPT-5.6 routing requires Codex CLI v0.144.0+; Astra requires v0.153.1+ and fails closed when the installed version cannot be identified.

Host-seat Fable 5.1 pins require Claude Code v2.1.255 or newer so the client recognizes the model and its 1M context window. The independent `claude-agent` SDK path instead requires `CLAUDE_SDK_API_KEY` and the `claude-agent` executable, with no Claude Code version floor. Its headless `claude` CLI fallback must be v2.1.255 or newer.

For simple tasks that don't need multi-AI perspectives, suggest using Claude directly without orchestration.

### Opus 5.5 and Opus 5 Effort Levels

The plugin keeps automatic phase routing at `high` for Opus 5.5 on Claude Code v2.1.280+ and Opus 5 on v2.1.219+. Opus 5.5's API default is `medium`; use `OCTOPUS_EFFORT_OVERRIDE` for a bounded step, or `OCTOPUS_OPUS5_AUTO_XHIGH=1` to restore the legacy automatic xhigh behavior:

- **probe / discover** — `high`
- **grasp / define** — `high`
- **tangle / develop** — `high`
- **ink / deliver** — `high`

`xhigh` falls back to `high` on older models where Claude Code does not expose it. Override per-session with `OCTOPUS_EFFORT_OVERRIDE=low|medium|high|xhigh|max`.

### Fable 5.1 Effort and Refusal Handling (opt-in pin only)

The phase table above is Opus guidance and does not carry over to a `claude-fable-5-1` or preserved `claude-fable-5` pin. On Fable, run `high` everywhere: effort applies per tool call, so `xhigh` does not extend runs — it makes each step overthink and widen scope. Raise effort only for a single capability-sensitive step.

When a Fable pin is detected through `OCTOPUS_OPUS_MODEL`, `OCTOPUS_CLAUDE_SDK_MODEL`, `OCTOPUS_CLAUDE_MODEL`, or `CLAUDE_MODEL`, orchestrate.sh auto-enables three guards via `scripts/lib/fable5.sh` and prints a one-line banner (`OCTOPUS_FABLE5_MODE=off` disables ordinary-pin guards; `=on` forces them):

- **Security reroute** — by default, security-audit dispatches (security-auditor role, squeeze workflow) do not run on Fable; the model resolver and dispatch swap in `claude-opus-5`. `OCTOPUS_FABLE5_MODE=off` is an explicit exception for ordinary pins, while exact model-qualified Fable security seats still fail closed.
- **Effort clamp** — `xhigh`/`max` clamp to `high` for opus-seat Fable dispatches, including explicit `OCTOPUS_EFFORT_OVERRIDE` values.
- **Refusal retry** — the claude-sdk shim retries a refused/empty Fable 5 dispatch once on `claude-opus-5` (`OCTOPUS_FABLE5_NO_RETRY=1` to opt out, `OCTOPUS_FABLE5_FALLBACK_MODEL` to pin another fallback) instead of rewording the prompt toward the classifier.

**Prompt hygiene (not machine-enforced):** never ask Fable 5 to reveal or transcribe its reasoning (triggers the `reasoning_extraction` refusal), avoid token countdowns, and drop "CRITICAL"/"MUST" emphasis unless strict compliance is required. Full profile: `skills/blocks/fable5-prompting.md`.

### Legacy Fast Opus preference

Claude's spawned `--print` CLI does not expose a supported `--fast` flag.
`OCTOPUS_OPUS_MODE=fast` remains recognized as a legacy preference, but it logs
a compatibility warning and uses standard subprocess dispatch. It does not
select a faster or higher-priced subprocess tier. `OCTOPUS_OPUS_MODE=standard`
also uses the standard command contract. Use `OCTOPUS_OPUS_MODEL` to pin a
specific supported model.

### Dynamic Workflows (Claude Code v2.1.154+)

Claude Code dynamic workflows are the right native path for huge single-Claude codebase migrations. Use Octopus when the job needs multi-provider disagreement, council deliberation, adversarial review, external model validation, or provider-specific blind-spot checks. Do not wrap a native dynamic workflow inside Octopus unless the handoff boundary is explicit.

## Auto Memory & Persistent Memory Integration (Claude Code v2.1.32+, enhanced in v2.1.33+)

Claude Code's auto memory (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md`) persists across conversations. When `SUPPORTS_PERSISTENT_MEMORY` is detected (v2.1.33+), memory persistence is guaranteed across sessions. Record the following in auto memory:

- **User's preferred autonomy mode** (interactive vs autonomous workflow execution)
- **Provider availability** (which CLIs are installed, auth methods configured)
- **Frequently used commands** (e.g., user prefers `/octo:quick` over full embrace)
- **Past project contexts** (tech stack, coding conventions, deployment targets)
- **Model preferences** (whether user prefers Opus 4.6 for premium tasks)

This enables faster workflow startup by skipping provider detection and preference questions in subsequent sessions.

---

## Enforcement Best Practices

Skills use the **Validation Gate Pattern** to ensure multi-LLM dispatch actually executes:

1. **Pre-check**: Run `check-providers.sh` to detect available providers before dispatch
2. **Dispatch**: Call `orchestrate.sh probe-single` per provider via background Agent subagents
3. **Validate**: After dispatch, verify synthesis files exist (`find ~/.claude-octopus/results/ -name "probe-synthesis-*" -mmin -10`)
4. **Fail loud**: If no synthesis files found, report "VALIDATION FAILED — multi-LLM dispatch did not execute" instead of silently falling back to Claude-only

> Developer reference (modular config, E2E testing, enforcement patterns): see `docs/DEVELOPER.md`

## Repo Orientation for Agents (read before editing)

The rules below encode failures that have already cost real CI rounds. Every one is enforced by a CI check; none of them is guesswork.

### Derived artifacts (never hand-edit)

| Generated file | Regenerate with | CI check that fails if stale |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (octo description + counts) | `./scripts/sync-marketplace.sh` | Smoke job "Verify marketplace.json is up to date" |
| `README.md`, `.claude-plugin/README.md`, and `PRODUCT.md` current facts | `./scripts/sync-readme.py` (included in `make sync`) | `tests/unit/test-readme-release-sync.sh` |

After changing commands, skills, agents, plugin metadata, release notes, models,
providers, or public facts: run `make sync`. During development, run focused
suites. Before an ordinary branch push, run `make ci-changed`; its checked-in
manifest always runs sync, smoke, packaging, and reachability checks and fails
closed to the full matrix for shared or unmapped changes. Before merge and
release, run `make ci-local` for sync-check plus the local smoke, unit, and
integration suites. Run the separate portability and symlink jobs in hosted CI.

### Hard rules (each one has broken a real PR)

- Never hand-write component counts into `plugin.json`'s description; the marketplace generator appends its own counts and `--check` fails on the collision. The generator derives the marketplace blurb from `plugin.json`'s description — to change it, edit `plugin.json` and run `make sync`, never `marketplace.json` itself.
- Shell scripts and Python helpers stay `100755`. Verify before push: `git diff origin/main...HEAD --summary | grep "mode change"` must be empty. CI enforces this (Portability Lint job; `allow-mode-change` PR label bypasses when intentional). Local test runs (`make ci-local`, some unit suites) chmod test fixtures as a side effect — recheck modes after every local test run, not just after editing.
- Provider case globs are order-sensitive: `claude-sdk*` must appear before `claude*`. A shadowed arm fails silently.
- Provider identity and capabilities belong in both registry tables. Keep the
  rows in parity and let `octo_provider_validate_contracts` reject incomplete
  registrations.
- In shell, quote env assignments as whole arguments: `"SOME_API_KEY=${VAR}"`, not `SOME_API_KEY="${VAR}"`. The expert-review secret scanner false-positives on the latter.
- Never put generated text or Markdown directly in shell GitHub-body arguments such as `--body` or `-f body=`. Stream it to `./scripts/safe-gh-comment.sh --repo OWNER/REPO ... -` on stdin (or pass a private file); the helper snapshots and validates outbound text before a silent write.
- CI waiters must assert the named required checks (Smoke Tests, Unit Tests, Integration Tests) are PRESENT and terminal. `all(.bucket != "pending")` over an empty list is vacuously true and fires instantly.
- Timeout-test fixtures must run LONGER than the pass bound, or a broken timeout false-passes. A test must be able to fail; prove it can.
- Tag releases on the squash-merge commit on `main`, never on the branch head. Full release procedure: `RELEASING.md`.
- Fork PRs stall at `action_required` after every push; approve with `gh api -X POST repos/nyldn/claude-octopus/actions/runs/<id>/approve`.
- Provider wiring is a 7-point checklist across 5 files: `docs/PROVIDERS.md`. Do not wing it from one example.
- MCP provider environment names come from
  `config/provider-env-allowlist.json`; keep its adapter tests green when it
  changes.

### Tracking and continuity

Use GitHub issues and pull requests for public work tracking. Do not commit
local tracker databases, credentials, generated session state, or private
handoff files to this repository. At session start, read this file,
`AGENTS.md`, `git status`, and the relevant issue or pull request. For
model-routing work, also read `docs/MODEL-ROUTING-STRATEGY.md`. Before handoff,
record verified tests and the exact commit or pull request state in the
conversation or pull request description.
