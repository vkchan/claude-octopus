# Releasing claude-octopus

Ordered checklist for shipping a release. Every step exists because skipping it has already broken CI at least once (v9.50.0 shipped in three CI rounds; all three failures were steps on this list). Human and agent contributors follow the same list.

## 0. Preconditions

- Work on a branch cut from current `main`. Branch protection is strict: the branch must be up to date with `main` at merge time, and the required checks are exactly **Smoke Tests**, **Unit Tests**, **Integration Tests**.
- Never build a release on top of a dirty working tree you do not own. Use a separate worktree (`git worktree add <dir> -b release/<name> origin/main`).

### Delivery contract for workflow methods

README What's New and the plugin description must describe released benefits
for end users. Keep CI changes, test-suite maintenance and internal development
process in the changelog or developer documentation. The plugin description
feeds generated README release summaries, so write it for plugin users.

Octopus distributes a local plugin through the existing Claude Code and Codex
marketplaces and source/package archives. Use the installation instructions in
[README.md](README.md#quickstart) and the host requirements in
[plugin compatibility](docs/PLUGIN-COMPATIBILITY.md). Keep development additions
under Unreleased until the release process publishes them.

For changes to workflow documentation, regenerate current facts and run the
changed-file selector before pushing:

```bash
make sync
make ci-changed
make validate-plugin-assembly
```

During development, run the focused suites for the paths you changed. Do not
repeat a suite already covered by the successful pre-push run:

```bash
bash tests/unit/test-workflow-method-contracts.sh
bash tests/unit/test-routing-preview.sh
bash tests/unit/test-setup-first-success.sh
bash tests/unit/test-setup-state.sh
```

Before releasing setup or packaging changes, install the candidate in disposable
Claude Code and Codex environments and verify discovery and the documented first
use. Repeat setup, interrupt and resume it, and verify preference readback.
Check update and removal behavior when those paths change. Preserve user
preferences, provider credentials, and existing setup receipts. Record which
host versions and platforms ran, along with any untested live provider paths.

Package checks must confirm workflow references, preview/setup helpers, shared
supervision, evaluation data, and third-party license notices in the extracted
artifact. Installation, discovery, local readiness, and a live task are separate
acceptance results. Follow the full release gates below before tagging or
publishing; documentation edits alone do not publish a version.

For method activation changes, the workflow contract suite checks prompt
transport and phase boundaries. Keep the shared selection block and its runtime
helper in the package. Inspect generated invocation metadata for unintended
changes. The A01-A12 evaluation scenarios cover command-level method selection;
record live cases as unrun until a host actually executes them. Static reference
checks do not establish model compliance or an independent review contribution.

## 1. Decide the version

Minor (9.x+1.0) for additive changes: new providers, new commands/skills/hooks, new env vars with safe defaults. Precedent: grok (9.48.0) and atlascloud shipped as minors. Major only for: breaking an existing config or provider contract, incompatible plugin manifest schema changes, or removing a provider category.

## 2. Bump every version location

Run `scripts/release.sh <version> "<summary>"` — it bumps every location below plus README count surfaces. The table is the verification list, not a manual procedure; after the script, `grep -rn "<old-version>" --include="*.json" --include="*.md" .` to catch anything it missed (e.g. the `routines.json` `$comment` version):

`scripts/orchestrate.sh release <version> "<summary>"` delegates to that same
release process. It requires both arguments. Use `--dry-run` before `release`
to preview the request without publishing. Its wrapper checks are covered by
`bash tests/unit/test-orchestrator-review-regressions.sh`; run the existing
release workflow suite when changing the underlying release process.

| File | Field |
|------|-------|
| `package.json` | `version` |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `version`, `description` (starts with `vX.Y.Z - ...`) |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | GENERATED, see step 3 |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin-manifest.json` | `version`, component counts |
| `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | `version` |
| `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` | `version` |
| `.factory-plugin/plugin.json` | `version` |
| `.factory-plugin/marketplace.json` | `metadata.version`, plugin entry `version` + `description` |
| `README.md` | version badge, current-release highlight/table row, component counts, model defaults, Claude Code capability floor/ceiling |
| `.claude-plugin/README.md` | public provider roster, minimum runtime, component counts |
| `PRODUCT.md` | current release, provider/component counts, Claude Code capability count/ceiling |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section (fold Unreleased into it) |

## 3. Regenerate derived artifacts (`make sync`)

Do NOT hand-edit these; CI diffs them against their generators:

| Generated artifact | Generator | CI check that fails if stale |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| `README.md`, `.claude-plugin/README.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `docs/COMMAND-REFERENCE.md`, and `docs/README.md` mechanical release facts | `./scripts/sync-readme.py` | `tests/unit/test-readme-release-sync.sh` and `make sync-check` |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin-manifest.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.factory-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.factory-plugin/marketplace.json` component counts | `./scripts/sync-readme.py` | `tests/unit/test-readme-release-sync.sh` and `make sync-check` |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (octo entry description + counts) | `./scripts/sync-marketplace.sh` | Smoke job step "Verify marketplace.json is up to date" |

Rules learned the hard way:
- The marketplace generator derives the feature summary from `plugin.json`'s `description` and appends current persona, command, and skill counts. To change the marketplace blurb, edit `plugin.json`'s description and run `make sync` — never edit `marketplace.json` directly. Never hand-write counts into `plugin.json`'s description; the generator appends them and `--check` will fail on the collision (the v9.50 description did this and shipped doubled counts until v9.51).
- The README generator derives the current release copy from `plugin.json`, model defaults from `scripts/lib/model-resolver.sh`, and Claude Code floor/ceiling facts from `scripts/orchestrate.sh` plus `scripts/lib/providers.sh`. Keep the `CURRENT RELEASE` and `CURRENT MODEL DEFAULTS` markers intact, plus exactly one version-table row marked `(new)`.
- README body prose counts must match `plugin.json`: the "**N commands** ... **N skills**" sentence and the "[All N skills]" link are asserted by `tests/unit/test-docs-sync.sh`.

`make sync` runs all generators; `make sync-check` runs every corresponding
check mode.

## 4. Validate locally with CI parity

```bash
make ci-local
```

This runs generated-file checks and the complete local smoke, unit, and
integration suites, including docs sync and plugin expert review. Hosted CI
separately checks Linux/macOS portability, ShellCheck,
package artifacts, and symlink paths. Local success does not replace those
checks on the exact release commit.

Known scanner gotcha: `tests/integration/test-plugin-expert-review.sh` greps tracked non-md files for `(API_KEY|SECRET|PASSWORD)\s*=\s*['\"]<20+ chars>`. A shell line like `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="${VAR}"` false-positives. Quote the whole env argument instead: `"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${VAR}"`.

## 5. Check file modes

```bash
git diff origin/main...HEAD --summary | grep "mode change"
```

Must be empty. Shell scripts and Python helpers must stay `100755`; both contributor tooling and editor-based rewrites have silently dropped exec bits before (root cause of PR #579's "Permission denied" CI failures). CI enforces this via the executable-bit lint in the Portability Lint job; the `allow-mode-change` PR label bypasses it for intentional mode changes.

## 6. PR and CI

- Open the PR against `main`. Same-repo branches run CI immediately; **fork PRs stall at `action_required`** until approved: `gh api -X POST repos/nyldn/claude-octopus/actions/runs/<run-id>/approve` (needed after every push to the fork branch).
- Known flake: macOS runner timing in `tests/unit/test-agent-lifecycle-events.sh` ("hook timeout did not return promptly"). If it hits, `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed` once before investigating.
- Squash-merge is the repo convention.
- `scripts/release.sh` waits up to 15 minutes by default so the macOS unit
  matrix can finish. Override only when necessary with
  `OCTO_RELEASE_CI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=<seconds>`.
- Automatic merge requires an explicit approved review and zero unresolved
  review threads across every paginated result page.

## 7. Tag AFTER the squash-merge

The tag must point at the merge commit on `main`, not at the branch head (squash rewrites the SHA):

`scripts/release.sh` creates and pushes this annotated tag automatically. If a
release is being recovered manually, use:

```bash
sha=$(gh pr view <pr> --json mergeCommit --jq .mergeCommit.oid)
git fetch origin main
git tag -a vX.Y.Z "$sha" -m "vX.Y.Z: one-line summary"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

## 8. GitHub Release

```bash
gh release create vX.Y.Z --verify-tag --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file <(awk '/^## \[X.Y.Z\]/{f=1;next} /^## \[/{f=0} f' CHANGELOG.md)
```

Marketplace consumers pin by release; a bare tag is not enough.

## 9. Post-merge verification

`scripts/release.sh` waits for the main-branch Test Suite on the exact squash
commit before it creates the tag or GitHub release. For manual recovery, watch
that run until `completed/success`. A release is not done while main is red.

### Anthropic text-seat acceptance

The `anthropic-api` provider ships with the plugin and needs Python 3, with no
additional package installation. Before changing this adapter or the Sonnet
host selection, run `bash tests/unit/test-anthropic-api-provider.sh` and
`bash tests/unit/test-sonnet-55-routing.sh`. The API suite executes the actual
isolated adapter against an inert transport and checks its outgoing Messages
payload, credential isolation, response parsing, role restrictions, and
unsupported thinking combinations. These checks do not establish live account
access or billable provider success. Run the normal branch and release gates
before publishing.
