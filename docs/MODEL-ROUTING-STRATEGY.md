# Frontier Model Routing Strategy

Status: accepted and implemented
Decision date: 2026-07-27
Last reviewed: 2026-10-01

## Decision

Claude Octopus uses Opus 5.5 (Opus 5 on Claude Code before v2.1.280) as its
premium lead model, GPT-5.6 Sol as the independent coding/review peer, and
Sonnet 5.5 as the standard Claude seat on Claude Code v2.1.284 and newer.
Older clients retain Sonnet 5 or Sonnet 4.6.
Fable 5.1 and GPT-6 Astra are cataloged but remain explicit capability
escalations. Neither is an automatic default, premium-tier target, or generic
fallback.

Fresh configurations adopt the new roster. Existing environment pins, session
overrides, and `providers.json` settings retain precedence and are not silently
rewritten.

## Catalog refresh, 2026-09-30

The catalog includes these additional models. This refresh changes available
choices and cost estimates. The OpenAI release defaults remain in place until the separate default
migration is delivered. The October 1 Claude update selects Sonnet 5.5 only
on supported clients.

| Model ID | API context limit | Standard USD per MTok, input/output |
|---|---:|---:|
| `gpt-6.1-sol` | 1,050,000 | $2 / $10 |
| `gpt-6-sol` | 1,050,000 | $2 / $10 |
| `gpt-6-luna` | 1,050,000 | $0.10 / $0.50 |
| `claude-sonnet-5-5` | 1,000,000 | $2 / $10 |

The three OpenAI models apply 2x input and 1.5x output prices to the whole
request when input exceeds 272,000 tokens. At exactly 272,000, standard prices
apply. These are API model limits, not a promise of the same effective context
in Codex. Dispatch also applies the configured transport context ceiling.
Use the client's model list to confirm account access before pinning a model.

GPT-6.1 Sol accepts `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` reasoning.
It rejects `none` and `minimal`. Tool calling requires Responses. The
Chat Completions adapter therefore allows GPT-6.1 Sol only with
`--tool-policy none`. GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna can use that adapter's tools
only with explicit `--reasoning-effort none`; use Codex for reasoning with
tools. Claude Code added Sonnet 5.5 in v2.1.284. Older clients can keep
their existing Sonnet pin.

The Chat Completions adapter maps `xhigh` and `max` to `high` for compatibility
with gateways. Codex can use the reasoning efforts supported by its model list.
OpenRouter `:nitro` and `:floor` routing suffixes retain the base model's
capability and standard-price estimates. Actual gateway prices can differ.

## Sonnet 5.5 API thinking, 2026-10-01

The explicit `anthropic-api` text seat uses the Messages API at
`https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`. Its Sonnet 5.5 default is high effort
and `thinking: {"type": "between_tools"}`. It has no tools, so this mode
returns text without up-front thinking. Automatic mode uses adaptive thinking
for `xhigh` and `max`, and for Opus 5.5. An explicit `between_tools` setting
with either effort or a different model fails before HTTP. Existing Claude
CLI and `claude-sdk` seats keep their execution behavior and credentials.

The seat requires an explicit `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and Python 3. It accepts
planning, research synthesis, and review of supplied text. It rejects
implementation, debugger, verifier, release, and unspecified roles. It cannot
inspect a checkout, browse, execute tests, or run coding tools. Requests are
single-turn; there is no tool loop or stored conversation to rewrite.

`OCTOPUS_ANTHROPIC_API_MODEL` or `providers.json` can select Sonnet 5.5 or Opus
5.5. Effort uses the existing role, phase, and provider reasoning precedence,
including `OCTOPUS_ANTHROPIC_API_REASONING`. Thinking accepts `auto`,
`adaptive`, or `between_tools` through `OCTOPUS_ANTHROPIC_API_THINKING`.
The request has no sampling overrides, beta headers, or forced tool choice.
Response parsing selects text blocks by type and leaves thinking blocks out
of the answer. Refusal, truncation, empty output, and unexpected tool calls
fail without switching models or retrying. The timeout defaults to 120 seconds
and output allowance to 8,192 tokens, including thinking; both are bounded.

Claude Code 2.1.286 does not expose `between_tools`. Its saved thinking toggle
and `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0` have no effect on Sonnet 5.5. The documented Agent
SDK thinking type also lacks `between_tools`. This API option applies only to
`anthropic-api`; passing API JSON as a CLI flag would not enable it.

## Roster

| Model | Default job | Standard price per MTok (input/output) |
|---|---|---:|
| Claude Opus 5.5 | architecture, planning, security reasoning, final judgment | $4 / $20 |
| Claude Opus 5 | premium lead when Opus 5.5 is unavailable; Fable security and refusal fallback | $5 / $25 |
| GPT-5.6 Sol | implementation, terminal work, independent code review | $4 / $20 |
| GPT-5.6 Terra | balanced Codex alternative | $2 / $12 |
| GPT-5.6 Luna | budget Codex alternative | $0.20 / $1.20 |
| Claude Sonnet 5.5 | standard Claude orchestration and synthesis on supported clients | $2 / $10 |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | standard Claude fallback on older clients | $2 / $10 |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | budget Claude work | $1 / $5 |
| Claude Fable 5.1 | opt-in judgment-class escalation, at most one automatic escalation per run | $10 / $50 |
| GPT-6 Astra | opt-in OpenAI-family escalation after Sol fails a hard acceptance test | $10 / $50 |

Opus 5 and Fable 5.1 are both Anthropic-family models. GPT-5.6 and Astra are
both OpenAI-family models. Agreement within either pair does not count as
independent provider diversity.

### Expensive-model admission

Fable 5.1 earns a seat for ambiguous architecture, difficult product or API
tradeoffs, long-horizon planning, and final arbitration when the current Opus lead has not met
the acceptance criteria. The `escalate` policies can admit one such dispatch
per run; direct pins remain the user's responsibility.

Astra is for a bounded, high-value OpenAI-family escalation after GPT-5.6 Sol
has failed a difficult acceptance test or a checked-in eval demonstrates a
material gain. Use an exact `codex:gpt-6-astra` seat, a provider-wide
`OCTOPUS_CODEX_MODEL=gpt-6-astra` pin, or configure the Premium tier's bounded
judgment escalation with `/octo:model-config tier premium codex gpt-6-astra`.
The bounded path keeps Sol as the normal seat and requires an
`OCTOPUS_MAX_COST_USD` ceiling that covers the projected list-price usage for
the prompt. Do not add Astra to routine implementation,
review fleets, councils, security passes, literal tier defaults, or fallback
chains. Its rollout is limited, and inputs above 272K tokens trigger OpenAI's
long-context multipliers for the whole request.

## Routing rules

1. Start generic, mergeable work with one capable owner.
2. Add another model only for a distinct job: research, implementation,
   adversarial review, security review, or final verification.
3. Explicit debate, council, squeeze, and multi-model commands still fan out
   because disagreement is their intended output.
4. Model choice never changes permissions, repository rules, or quality gates.
5. User and project configuration always beats release defaults.

### Automatic Premium peer check

Premium single-owner routes automatically add one independent peer check after
the owner has produced a result. The root workflow owns this decision, so
nested provider seats do not start more peer calls. Budget and Standard routes
keep the single-owner path unless the user explicitly chooses an existing
multi-model workflow.

The automatic check normally pairs an OpenAI-family owner with an Anthropic
peer, or an Anthropic owner with GPT-5.6 Sol. It requires different canonical
providers and known model families before it reports independent coverage.
Unknown, gateway-only, same-family, or unavailable peers are reported as
incomplete coverage. Fable 5.1 and GPT-6 Astra remain explicit escalations and
are not added automatically.

The check is skipped for quick/direct work, setup/status, image and research
routes, and workflows that already own review, council, debate, crossfire,
parallel, or full-review behavior. Use
`OCTOPUS_PREMIUM_PEER_CHECK=off` to disable this automatic addition. A peer
response is advisory, and only a captured terminal result can be
reported as reviewed.

### Contextual review seat overrides

The contextual code-review pipeline supports explicit model-qualified seat identities
using the same `provider:model` convention as the design-review ceremony. These
overrides are useful when a curated lineup must preserve semantic roles across
providers instead of inheriting the review fleet's provider defaults:

| Review seat | Environment override |
|---|---|
| Logic | `OCTOPUS_REVIEW_LOGIC_AGENT` |
| Security | `OCTOPUS_REVIEW_SECURITY_AGENT` |
| Architecture | `OCTOPUS_REVIEW_ARCHITECTURE_AGENT` |
| CVE research | `OCTOPUS_REVIEW_CVE_AGENT` |
| Diversity / independent perspective | `OCTOPUS_REVIEW_DIVERSITY_AGENT` |
| Verifier | `OCTOPUS_REVIEW_VERIFIER_AGENT` |
| Debater | `OCTOPUS_REVIEW_DEBATER_AGENT` |
| Synthesizer | `OCTOPUS_REVIEW_SYNTHESIZER_AGENT` |

For example, `OCTOPUS_REVIEW_SYNTHESIZER_AGENT=commandcode:thinkingmachines/inkling-small`
keeps the synthesis seat on that exact provider and model. Registered aliases
such as `command-code` and `anthropic` are accepted at the configuration boundary
and normalized to executable provider names.

Each seat override must contain both a provider and a model. Blank values,
provider-only values, unsafe whitespace, unknown providers, and models blocked by
the provider's model restriction are rejected. Exact seat overrides never use a
restriction-service fallback because that would run a different model than the
one requested. Update the seat or its model allowlist instead. The Fable 5
security guard follows the same rule: an exact Fable pin on a security seat is
rejected rather than rerouted to another model.

Review lifecycle records and the final provider report keep the canonical
provider and exact model as separate fields, so two models served by one
provider remain distinct. Legacy provider-only status records are still read.

Provider admission still applies independently. A seat fails closed when its
provider is not admitted by the active provider allowlist.
`OCTOPUS_REVIEW_SINGLE_PROVIDER` remains the global compatibility override and
takes precedence over individual seat overrides. Run `octopus fleet review` to
inspect the effective logic, security, architecture, CVE, diversity, verifier,
debater, and synthesizer seats before starting a review.

Round-1 seat overrides are additive when their semantic role is absent from the
configured review fleet; unconfigured seats retain the existing fleet behavior.

## Eval-backed routing in v10

V10 exposes deterministic routing decisions through
`octo_route_task_class` and `octo_route_decision`. These functions do not call
providers or inspect host authentication. Their checked-in oracle is
`data/routing/v10-eval-cases.json`, so policy changes require a reviewable test
case rather than an opaque runtime heuristic.

Set `routing.policy` to `"eval"` in `providers.json`, or use the
`OCTOPUS_ROUTING_POLICY=eval` session override, to apply the evaluated task
class when no higher-precedence model route exists. The model resolver
considers the task class only after environment pins, session overrides, role
and phase routes, and provider role defaults; it is more specific than generic
capability, cost-tier, and release defaults:

| Task class | Codex seat | Claude seat |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanical | GPT-5.6 Luna | Haiku 4.5 |
| Balanced | GPT-5.6 Terra | current supported Sonnet |
| Premium | GPT-5.6 Sol | Opus 5.5, with Opus 5 fallback |
| Review or security | GPT-5.6 Sol | Opus 5.5, with Opus 5 fallback |

The policy and task class are part of the model-cache key. A mechanical result
therefore cannot be reused for a later premium seat. Routing decisions report a
reason such as `eval-mechanical`, `user-pin`, `project-route`, or
`cross-vendor-verifier`.

Independent verification is a vendor-family property, not a model-name
comparison. Opus and Fable are both Anthropic-family models. If Fable or Opus
authored a result that requires independent verification, the evaluated route
selects a non-Anthropic verifier. An explicit same-family verifier pin is still
honored, but coverage is marked `degraded-same-family`.

Role defaults:

- `architect`, `strategist`, `security-reviewer`, `implementer-heavy`: current
  Opus, preferring Opus 5.5 on Claude Code v2.1.280+ and Opus 5 on v2.1.219+.
- `implementer`, `code-reviewer`: GPT-5.6 Sol.
- `synthesizer`: current Sonnet, preferring Sonnet 5.5 on Claude Code v2.1.284+ and Sonnet 5 on v2.1.197+.
- `researcher`: Antigravity, retaining an independent research role.

## Fallbacks

Dispatch fallback policy is configuration-driven. The built-in `default` chain
tries these routing roles after the workflow's preferred agent fails:

1. `code-reviewer`
2. `implementer-heavy`
3. `architect`

Each role resolves through the existing `routing.roles` table, so the fallback
chain does not hard-code a provider or model. A user can replace the chain in
`~/.claude-octopus/config/providers.json`:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "fallbackChains": {
      "default": [
        { "role": "code-reviewer" },
        { "role": "implementer-heavy" },
        { "role": "architect" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Candidates may also use explicit `{ "provider": "...", "model": "..." }`
objects when pinning is required, but role-based candidates are preferred.
`run_agent_sync_fallback_chain` applies the same ordered chain to process
failures, empty output, and caller-defined semantic/protocol validation
failures. The task's semantic role and phase remain unchanged while the routing
candidate changes. Exhausting the chain fails closed.

Invalid JSON, unknown roles, malformed candidates, and incorrect chain types
stop fallback dispatch. Provider aliases are canonicalized, equivalent attempts
are deduplicated, and session model overrides retain precedence over role
defaults.

The existing model-version fallbacks below are separate: they resolve a model
within a provider family rather than selecting a different dispatch candidate.

- Opus: Opus 5.5 → Opus 5 → Opus 4.8 → Opus 4.7 → Opus 4.6.
- Sonnet: Sonnet 5.5 → Sonnet 5 → Sonnet 4.6.
- Fable 5/5.1 refusal and security fallback: Opus 5, overridable with
  `OCTOPUS_FABLE5_FALLBACK_MODEL`.
- Fable input gate: 524,288 bytes by default, overridable with
  `OCTOPUS_FABLE5_MAX_INPUT_BYTES`. An oversized prompt falls back before any
  Fable provider command is invoked and does not consume the run's single
  Fable escalation seat.
- Fable 5.1 effort is capped at `high` by default. A bounded high-value run can
  raise the cap with `OCTOPUS_FABLE5_MAX_EFFORT=xhigh|max` without disabling
  the security, input, or refusal guards.
- GPT-5.6 requires Codex CLI v0.144.0 or newer.
- GPT-6 Astra requires Codex CLI v0.153.1 or newer. Unknown versions fail
  closed. The generic OpenAI-compatible adapter blocks Astra tool use because
  that adapter uses Chat Completions; use Codex CLI for tool-enabled work.

Every Fable dispatch decision is written to the v10 run event ledger with the
requested model, resolved model, prompt bytes, phase, role, and reason. The
single escalation claim is atomic in the durable run directory, so sibling
subprocesses cannot each spend a premium seat.

## Bounded orchestration experiments

The checked-in audit corpus replays known failures without calling a provider:

```bash
./scripts/helpers/replay-contract-evals.sh
```

New corpus entries must be sanitized, deterministic, and tied to the production
contract that owns the failure. Keep a held-out set when comparing review
strategies. Do not tune a strategy against every case used to score it.

The first supported comparison is one owner plus one known-family independent
verifier against a larger council. The input names the held-out
`ground_truth_finding_ids` once, then records each run with its validated
findings, whether each finding reached the result, reviewer identities, elapsed
time, tokens, and cost. Score the run offline:

```bash
./scripts/helpers/score-review-fleet.py experiment-runs.json
```

The scorer reports unique validated findings, validated-finding recall,
unresolved single-reviewer findings, latency, tokens, and cost. Agreement count
is deliberately absent. Keep the experiment opt-in until held-out results show
that the extra seats find enough additional defects to justify their time and
cost.

An Astra trial has stricter admission. Before the run, name the acceptance
criterion that Sol failed and retain that result as evidence. Use an exact
`codex:gpt-6-astra` seat for a one-off trial, or configure the Premium tier's
bounded judgment escalation after a repeatable gain is established. Both paths
need a per-run `OCTOPUS_MAX_COST_USD` ceiling that covers the projected
list-price usage for the prompt. Do not persist Astra as a provider
default, literal tier route, council seat, review-fleet seat, or fallback.

## Prompt policy

For Opus 5.5, Opus 5, and Sonnet 5, prompts should state the goal, relevant context,
boundaries, reasons for unusual constraints, and checkable acceptance criteria.
Avoid duplicated reminders, all-caps emphasis without a real compliance need,
token countdowns, and requests to reveal hidden reasoning. The runtime policy
block is `skills/blocks/frontier-model-routing.md`; Fable-specific constraints
remain in `skills/blocks/fable5-prompting.md`.
