# Test Coverage Audit

## Artifact consistency before implementation

When invoked at a spec/plan/tasks boundary, use the feature boundary adapter rather than this skill's code-test generation mode. It automatically runs bounded deterministic checks for coverage, declared paths, stable IDs, explicit terminology/enums/counts and verified policy references. A single artifact skips analysis; a clean pass costs no seat. Reports are advisory and quote the original sources. Escalation uses at most one independent seat, and unavailable or failed semantic review leaves the deterministic results usable.

## Overview

Trace every codepath in a diff, map each path against existing tests, visualize coverage gaps, and auto-generate tests for uncovered paths.

**Core principle:** Trace codepaths in changed files -> Map against existing tests -> Score coverage quality -> Generate tests for gaps -> Report before/after counts.


## Caps and Limits

These hard limits prevent runaway analysis:

- **30 code paths max** per audit. If a diff yields more than 30, prioritize by complexity and risk (error paths, security-sensitive branches, public API surfaces first).
- **20 tests generated max** per audit. Focus on highest-impact gaps first.
- **2-minute per-test exploration cap.** If understanding a single test path takes longer than 2 minutes, mark it as "needs manual review" and move on.


## Phase 1: Codepath Tracing

### Step 1: Identify Changed Files

Determine the diff scope. Use the most relevant source:

```bash
# PR diff
git diff --name-only main...HEAD

# Staged changes
git diff --name-only --cached

# Last commit
git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD
```

Filter to source code files only (exclude configs, docs, generated files).

### Step 2: Trace Data Flow Through Every Branch

For each changed file, you MUST trace:

1. **Conditionals** -- Every `if/else`, `switch/case`, ternary, and pattern match. Each branch is a separate codepath.
2. **Error paths** -- Every `catch`, `throw`, error return, validation failure, and early return with error. WHY: Error paths are the most common source of untested bugs.
3. **Function calls** -- Every function invoked from changed code. Trace one level deep into callees to identify integration boundaries.
4. **Loop boundaries** -- Empty collection, single item, and multi-item paths through loops.
5. **Guard clauses** -- Every early return, null check, and permission gate.

### Step 3: Build the Codepath Inventory

Produce a structured inventory:

```markdown
## Codepath Inventory: [filename]

| # | Path Description | Type | Risk |
|---|-----------------|------|------|
| 1 | validateUser() happy path | conditional | low |
| 2 | validateUser() missing email | error | medium |
| 3 | validateUser() invalid format | error | medium |
| 4 | processOrder() empty cart guard | guard | high |
| 5 | processOrder() payment timeout | error | high |
| 6 | processOrder() success | conditional | low |
```

**Type categories:** `conditional`, `error`, `guard`, `loop-boundary`, `integration`, `async`

**Risk assessment:** `high` = user-facing failure or data loss, `medium` = degraded behavior, `low` = cosmetic or logging


## Phase 2: Test Mapping and Quality Scoring

### Step 1: Search for Existing Tests

For each file in the diff, search the test directory for related tests:

```bash
# Find test files that reference the changed file or its exports
# Search by filename pattern
find tests/ -name "*[changed_file_stem]*" -type f

# Search by import/require of the changed module
grep -rl "import.*from.*[module_name]" tests/
grep -rl "require.*[module_name]" tests/

# Search by function name references
grep -rl "[function_name]" tests/
```

### Step 2: Score Test Quality

For each codepath, assess existing test coverage with this rubric:

| Rating | Meaning | Criteria |
|--------|---------|----------|
| ★★★ | Behavior + edge cases tested | Tests assert behavior AND cover boundary conditions, error cases, and edge inputs |
| ★★ | Happy path tested | Tests cover the success path but miss error branches or edge cases |
| ★ | Smoke test only | Test exists but only checks the function runs without error (no meaningful assertions) |
| ☆ | No test found | No test references this codepath at all |

### Step 3: Produce Coverage Map

Map each codepath to its test coverage:

```markdown
## Coverage Map: [filename]

| # | Codepath | Test File | Rating | Notes |
|---|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | validateUser() happy path | test-user.sh:42 | ★★★ | Asserts valid + invalid inputs |
| 2 | validateUser() missing email | test-user.sh:58 | ★★ | Tests missing, not malformed |
| 3 | validateUser() invalid format | -- | ☆ | No test for format validation |
| 4 | processOrder() empty cart guard | -- | ☆ | Guard clause untested |
| 5 | processOrder() payment timeout | test-orders.sh:30 | ★ | Checks no crash, no assertions |
| 6 | processOrder() success | test-orders.sh:15 | ★★★ | Full integration test |
```


## Phase 3: Coverage Diagram

After completing the map, produce an ASCII coverage summary. This is the primary output artifact.

```
COVERAGE: 5/12 paths tested (42%)
  Code paths: 3/5 (60%)
  User flows: 2/7 (29%)
GAPS: 7 paths need tests
```

Break down by category:

```
BY TYPE:
  conditional:  3/4 tested (75%)  ████████░░
  error:        1/5 tested (20%)  ██░░░░░░░░
  guard:        0/2 tested  (0%)  ░░░░░░░░░░
  integration:  1/1 tested (100%) ██████████

BY RISK:
  high:    1/3 tested (33%)  ███░░░░░░░
  medium:  2/5 tested (40%)  ████░░░░░░
  low:     2/4 tested (50%)  █████░░░░░
```

Use full block for covered and light shade for uncovered. 10-character bar. Always show exact fractions and percentages.


## Phase 4: Auto-Generate Tests

### Step 1: Detect Project Test Conventions

Before generating any tests, you MUST detect the project's testing patterns:

```markdown
**Detected Test Conventions:**
- Framework: [jest/vitest/pytest/bash/go test/etc.]
- Location: [tests/ | __tests__/ | src/**/*.test.* | etc.]
- Naming: [test-*.sh | *.test.ts | *_test.go | etc.]
- Style: [BDD describe/it | xUnit | TAP | custom]
- Helpers: [test-utils.ts | conftest.py | helpers/ | etc.]
- Assertion library: [built-in | chai | assert | etc.]
```

### Step 2: Generate Tests for Uncovered Paths

For each no-test and smoke-only codepath, generate a test that:

1. **Follows project naming conventions** -- same directory structure, same file naming pattern
2. **Uses existing test helpers** -- import from the same test utilities the project already uses
3. **Tests behavior, not implementation** -- assert observable outcomes, not internal state
4. **Covers the specific gap** -- targets the exact branch or error path identified in Phase 1
5. **Includes edge cases** -- aim for full coverage on each generated test

### Step 3: Present Generated Tests

For each generated test, show:

```markdown
### Generated: test for [codepath description]
**Covers:** Codepath #N from [filename]
**Raises coverage:** from no-test to full coverage

[test code block]
```

### Step 4: Report Before/After

After generating all tests, show the coverage change:

```
BEFORE: 5/12 paths tested (42%)
AFTER:  11/12 paths tested (92%)
  New tests generated: 6
  Remaining gaps: 1 (manual review needed)
```


## Integration with Other Skills

### With flow-deliver / skill-code-review

Coverage audit runs as a complement to code review. When invoked during deliver phase:
1. Code review assesses quality and correctness
2. Coverage audit assesses test completeness
3. Both feed into the ship/no-ship decision

### With skill-tdd

If coverage audit finds gaps in new code, recommend the user adopt TDD for the next iteration. Coverage audit fixes existing gaps; TDD prevents future ones.

### With skill-verification-gate

After generating tests, use skill-verification-gate to run the test suite and confirm the new tests pass.


## Red Flags -- Do Not Do This

| Action | Why It Is Wrong |
|--------|-----------------|
| Count lines instead of paths | Line coverage misses branch coverage entirely |
| Generate tests without checking conventions | Tests that do not match project style will be rejected |
| Test implementation details | Brittle tests that break on refactoring |
| Skip error paths | Error paths are where most bugs live |
| Exceed the 30-path cap | Analysis becomes unfocused and slow |
| Generate more than 20 tests | Diminishing returns; focus on highest impact |
| Spend more than 2 min on one path | Mark as needs-manual-review and move on |


## Quick Reference

```
1. TRACE   -> Identify all codepaths in the diff (max 30)
2. MAP     -> Find existing tests for each path
3. SCORE   -> Rate coverage quality (no-test / smoke / happy-path / full)
4. DIAGRAM -> ASCII coverage visualization
5. GENERATE -> Auto-create tests for gaps (max 20)
6. REPORT  -> Before/after test counts
```
