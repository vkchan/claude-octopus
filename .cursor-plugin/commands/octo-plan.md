# Plan - Intelligent Plan Builder

Load `skills/blocks/engineering-method-selection.md` from the installed plugin
and apply only the methods relevant to this task. Preserve this entry point's
execution contract and output format. Read referenced skills as instructions;
do not invoke the current command recursively or add provider calls from a seat.

**Creates strategic execution plans based on user intent. Saves plans for review and optional execution with /octo:embrace.**

## Key Behavior

- **Creates plans** - Captures intent, analyzes requirements, generates weighted execution strategy
- **Saves to files** - Stores each plan and intent contract in a unique run directory under the project-owned `.octo/plans/` namespace, or under octo-owned session storage when there is no project
- **Doesn't execute** - Plans are saved for review; execution requires user confirmation
- **Optional execution** - Can load `/octo:embrace` after explicit user approval or execute later
- **Prototype handoff** - Can propose one bounded experiment without writing or launching providers in native plan mode

## Prototype proposal

When one risky assumption blocks the plan, offer a prototype with one question,
hypothesis, deadline, artifact path, source revision, and success signal. In native
read-only plan mode, present the proposal only. After explicit execution approval,
load `skill-prototype` and store artifacts through `scripts/plan-storage.sh`.
Choosing a prototype does not authorize deployment, provider calls, browser login,
repository rewrites, or new permissions.

Before filing implementation tasks, map unresolved decisions and their dependency
graph. A cycle withholds ready status. Claims must use the configured tracker's
atomic operation and be read back before work starts. On tracker failure, save an
explicitly unfiled proposal in the plan directory and stop tracker writes.

## 🤖 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

### MANDATORY: Detect Plan Mode Write Conflict Before Starting

**THIS CHECK RUNS FIRST — before intent capture, before any artifact write.**

Native plan mode blocks all Write/Edit tool calls until `ExitPlanMode` is
called. If you are currently in plan mode (you entered it earlier this session
or the harness placed you in it), attempting to write `${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-intent.md`
or `${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-plan.md` will silently fail, producing a degraded native
plan instead of a full octo multi-provider plan.

**If you are in plan mode when /octo:plan is invoked, you MUST:**

1. Emit this exact warning as the very first output:

   ```text
   ⚠️  OCTO PLAN DEGRADED — Plan Mode Write Conflict

   Native plan mode is active. Octo cannot save its planning artifacts
   (session-intent.md, session-plan.md) while plan mode
   restricts writes. You are getting display-only output — this is NOT
   a full octo multi-provider plan.

   To get the full octo plan:
     1. Exit or cancel native plan mode
     2. Re-run /octo:plan

   Continuing with plan visualization only (no artifacts saved)…
   ```

2. Skip Step 2 (Create Intent Contract) and Step 5 (Save the Plan) entirely.
   Do not attempt these writes — they will silently fail.
3. Complete Steps 1, 3, 4, and 6 so the user sees the visualization.
4. Repeat the re-run reminder at the end of Step 6.

**Do NOT silently fall through to generic native planning. The user invoked
/octo:plan deliberately. A visible degradation warning is mandatory.**

---

### Resolve Plan Storage Location

**After confirming native plan mode is not active, resolve one unique run
directory before creating either artifact. Every other step in this command
reads or writes `${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-intent.md` and
`${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-plan.md`. Never substitute a bare
`.claude/session-intent.md` or `.claude/session-plan.md` literal:**

```bash
OCTO_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin}"
PLAN_STORAGE="$OCTO_ROOT/scripts/plan-storage.sh"
FEATURE_CONTEXT=$(bash "$OCTO_ROOT/scripts/helpers/feature-workflow.sh" prepare plan "<feature name>" "${OCTOPUS_FEATURE:-}")
if jq -e '.ambiguous == true' <<< "$FEATURE_CONTEXT" >/dev/null; then
  echo "Select a feature directory before planning"
  exit 1
fi
if jq -e 'has("spec_path")' <<< "$FEATURE_CONTEXT" >/dev/null; then
  FEATURE_SELECTOR=$(jq -r 'if .feature == "" then .spec_path else .feature end' <<< "$FEATURE_CONTEXT")
  FEATURE_RUNTIME_DIR=$(jq -r '.runtime_dir' <<< "$FEATURE_CONTEXT")
  OCTOPUS_SESSION_PLANS="$FEATURE_RUNTIME_DIR/plan-drafts"
  export OCTOPUS_SESSION_PLANS
  bash "$OCTO_ROOT/scripts/helpers/feature-workflow.sh" boundary plan "$FEATURE_SELECTOR"
fi
OCTO_PLAN_DIR="$("$PLAN_STORAGE" create "$PWD")" || {
  echo "Unable to resolve safe plan draft storage" >&2
  exit 1
}
echo "Plan draft directory: ${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}"
```

If several features exist, ask the user to select one with the host question tool, then rerun storage resolution. Do not choose the newest directory.

The resolver hard-blocks the global `~/.claude/` directory, detects git and marker-file project roots, creates a unique directory for every invocation, and records that directory for the current host session and workspace. Running `/octo:plan` from `$HOME` or another non-project directory uses `~/.claude-octopus/sessions/<session-id>/plans/<run-id>/`. Project runs use `<project-root>/.octo/plans/<run-id>/`.

Keep the absolute path printed by the resolver and use that exact path in every later Read, Write, Edit, and Bash action. If the path must be recovered in a later shell, run `"$PLAN_STORAGE" current "$PWD"`. Report the resolved absolute path, not a relative placeholder, in every confirmation message shown to the user.

When a portable feature is selected, drafts stay in runtime and the accepted plan and task contract are published into that feature. Read the bound policy source, digest and numbered passages before planning. Present the boundary's question batch once through the available native host question tool. Skipped or noninteractive questions remain open. Preserve the feature's prior task identities and retired-ID history.

Planning emits an `octopus-tasks` JSON fence with schema_version 1, the selected feature_id and tasks. Every task has a persistent T001-style ID and identity, requirement links, kind, title, reads, files, creates, dependencies, parallel_hint and status. Use the existing IDs on replan. Split tasks use new IDs and a supersedes relation. A parallel hint can reduce concurrency; the dispatcher independently resolves paths and working-tree state at every wave.

### Provider preflight

Before launching any Codex or other provider-backed planning seat, capture one
authoritative status snapshot and retain it for the later visualization:

```bash
OCTO_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin}"
provider_helper="$OCTO_ROOT/scripts/helpers/check-providers.sh"
if [[ ! -x "$provider_helper" ]]; then
  echo "Claude Octopus provider readiness helper is unavailable; planning in Claude-only mode." >&2
  PROVIDER_STATUS=""
else
  PROVIDER_STATUS="$("$provider_helper" 2>/dev/null || true)"
fi
printf '%s\n' "$PROVIDER_STATUS"
```

If the selected provider is unavailable or unauthenticated, keep the plan in
Claude-only mode, name the failed preflight, and offer `/octo:setup` or
`/octo:skill-doctor` as the recovery path. Do not describe an unstarted
provider seat as completed.

### MANDATORY COMPLIANCE — DO NOT SKIP

**When the user explicitly invokes `/octo:plan`, you MUST execute the structured planning workflow below.** You are PROHIBITED from doing the task directly, skipping the intent capture questions, or deciding the task is "too simple" for structured planning. The user chose this command deliberately — respect that choice.

---

When the user invokes this command (e.g., `/octo:plan <arguments>`):

### Step 1: Capture Comprehensive Intent

**CRITICAL: Start by capturing the user's full intent using structured questions.**

Ask 5 comprehensive questions to understand what they're trying to accomplish:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What are you ultimately trying to accomplish?",
      header: "Goal",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Research a topic", description: "Gather information and options"},
        {label: "Make a decision", description: "Choose between alternatives"},
        {label: "Build something", description: "Create implementation or artifact"},
        {label: "Review/improve existing", description: "Assess and enhance what's there"},
        {label: "I'll describe it", description: "Let me write my own goal"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "How much do you already know about this?",
      header: "Knowledge",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Just starting", description: "Need to learn the landscape"},
        {label: "Some familiarity", description: "Know basics, need deeper dive"},
        {label: "Well-informed", description: "Know options, need execution"},
        {label: "Expert", description: "Just need implementation/validation"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "How clear is the scope?",
      header: "Clarity",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Vague idea", description: "Not sure exactly what I need"},
        {label: "General direction", description: "Know the area, need specifics"},
        {label: "Clear requirements", description: "Know what to build"},
        {label: "Fully specified", description: "Have detailed specifications"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "What defines success for you?",
      header: "Success",
      multiSelect: true,
      options: [
        {label: "Clear understanding", description: "I know what to do next"},
        {label: "Team alignment", description: "Everyone agrees on approach"},
        {label: "Working solution", description: "Implementation that functions"},
        {label: "Production-ready", description: "Fully tested and validated"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "What are your key constraints?",
      header: "Constraints",
      multiSelect: true,
      options: [
        {label: "Time pressure", description: "Need results quickly"},
        {label: "Must fit architecture", description: "Constrained by existing systems"},
        {label: "Team skill set", description: "Limited by team capabilities"},
        {label: "High stakes", description: "Significant risk if wrong"}
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

**If user selected "I'll describe it" for goal, follow up with:**
```
Can you describe in 1-2 sentences what you're trying to accomplish?
```

### Step 2: Create Intent Contract

**Use the skill-intent-contract system to capture this formally:**

1. Create `${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-intent.md` with:
   - Job statement (what user is trying to accomplish)
   - Success criteria (from their answers)
   - Boundaries (derived from constraints)
   - Context (knowledge level, clarity, constraints)

2. Store answers from the 5 questions in the contract

### Step 3: Analyze and Route (v7.24.0+: Hybrid Planning)

**NEW in v7.24.0:** Intelligent routing between native plan mode and octopus workflows.

#### Native Plan Mode Detection

First, check if native `EnterPlanMode` would be beneficial:

```javascript
// Conditions that favor native plan mode
const nativePlanModePreferred = (
  goal === "Build something" &&
  scope_clarity === "Clear requirements" &&
  knowledge_level === "Well-informed" &&
  !requires_multi_ai &&  // Simple single-phase planning
  !success.includes("Team alignment")  // No multi-perspective needs
)

if (nativePlanModePreferred) {
  // Suggest native plan mode
  AskUserQuestion({
    questions: [{
      question: "Would you like to use native plan mode or multi-AI orchestration?",
      header: "Planning Mode",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {
          label: "Native plan mode (Recommended)",
          description: "Fast, single-phase planning with Claude. Good for straightforward implementation plans."
        },
        {
          label: "Multi-AI orchestration",
          description: "Research with Claude plus available external providers. Better for complex problems requiring diverse perspectives."
        }
      ]
    }]
  })
}
```

**When to use native EnterPlanMode:**
- ✅ Single-phase planning (just need a plan, no execution)
- ✅ Well-defined requirements
- ✅ Quick architectural decisions
- ✅ When context clearing after planning is OK

**When to use /octo:plan (octopus workflows):**
- ✅ Multi-AI orchestration (Claude plus available external providers)
- ✅ Double Diamond 4-phase execution
- ✅ State needs to persist across sessions
- ✅ Complex intent capture with routing
- ✅ High-stakes decisions requiring multiple perspectives

#### Routing Logic (Octopus Workflows)

```
IF knowledge_level == "Just starting":
  DISCOVER_WEIGHT += 20%

IF scope_clarity == "Vague idea":
  DEFINE_WEIGHT += 15%
  DISCOVER_WEIGHT += 10%

IF scope_clarity == "Fully specified":
  DEVELOP_WEIGHT += 15%
  DELIVER_WEIGHT += 10%

IF "Working solution" OR "Production-ready" in success:
  DEVELOP_WEIGHT += 15%
  DELIVER_WEIGHT += 10%

IF "High stakes" in constraints:
  DELIVER_WEIGHT += 15%  (more validation)
  requires_multi_ai = true  (multiple perspectives needed)

IF goal == "Research a topic":
  ROUTE_TO: discover (weighted heavy)
  requires_multi_ai = true

IF goal == "Make a decision":
  ROUTE_TO: debate (always — decisions benefit from structured disagreement)
  requires_multi_ai = true

IF goal == "Build something":
  IF scope_clarity in ["Clear requirements", "Fully specified"] AND NOT requires_multi_ai:
    SUGGEST: native plan mode
  ELSE:
    ROUTE_TO: embrace (all 4 phases, weighted)
    IF "High stakes" in constraints OR scope == "Large feature" OR scope == "Full system":
      SUGGEST: embrace with debate gates enabled

IF goal == "Review/improve existing":
  ROUTE_TO: review OR deliver
  IF "High stakes" in constraints:
    SUGGEST: review with debate validation
```

#### Default Phase Weights

Start with 25% each, adjust based on signals:
- Discover: 25% ± 20% (research & exploration)
- Define: 25% ± 15% (scope & boundaries)
- Develop: 25% ± 15% (implementation)
- Deliver: 25% ± 15% (validation & review)

#### Debate Integration in Plans

When the plan includes debate-worthy decision points, surface them explicitly:

```
🐙 DEBATE CHECKPOINTS IN THIS PLAN:

🔸 After Define phase: "Is [chosen approach] the right design?"
   Triggers: 1-round adversarial debate on approach risks

🔸 After Develop phase: "Is this implementation ready to ship?"
   Triggers: 1-round collaborative debate on edge cases
```

Plans with `"High stakes"` constraints or `"Make a decision"` goals should always
recommend debate gates. Include the debate checkpoint markers in the saved plan
(`${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-plan.md`) so `/octo:embrace` knows to activate them.

### Step 4: Present the Plan

Use the `PROVIDER_STATUS` snapshot captured during Provider preflight. Do not
run another provider check. Include every `provider:status` line between its
`PROVIDER_CHECK_START` and `PROVIDER_CHECK_END` markers in the visualization.
Render `available` as ready, `degraded` as needing attention, and `missing` as
not configured. Preserve provider names exactly so newly registered providers
appear without another command edit.

**Display a comprehensive plan visualization with ACTUAL provider status:**

```
🐙 **CLAUDE OCTOPUS PLAN**

WHAT YOU'LL END UP WITH:
[Clear description of the deliverable based on their goal]

HOW WE'LL GET THERE:

DISCOVER ████████████████ 40%
Research the landscape — Gather evidence and options
→ /octo:discover (extended depth)

DEFINE ████ 15%
Lock the scope — Confirm boundaries and approach
→ /octo:define (light touch)

DEVELOP ████████████ 30%
Build the solution — Create the implementation
→ /octo:develop

DELIVER ██████ 15%
Validate quality — Review and refine
→ /octo:deliver

Provider Availability:
[one row for each captured provider:status entry]
[provider name exactly]: [ready / needing attention / not configured]

YOUR INVOLVEMENT: [Checkpoints / Semi-autonomous / Hands-off]

Time estimate: [Rough estimate based on scope]
```

Render every provider status from `PROVIDER_STATUS`; do not replace the
preflight snapshot with separate command, environment, or Ollama checks. A
status other than `available` cannot be displayed as a completed provider seat.

**PROHIBITED: Displaying only "🔵 Claude: Available ✓" without listing all providers.**

### Step 5: Save the Plan

For a selected feature, Write/Edit only the runtime drafts. Publish the accepted plan through the shared writer:

```bash
bash "$OCTO_ROOT/scripts/helpers/feature-workflow.sh" save plan \
  "$OCTO_PLAN_DIR/session-plan.md" "<actual author provider>" "<actual model or unknown>" \
  "<planning run id>" "$FEATURE_SELECTOR"
```

The adapter reconciles and publishes the labelled task contract as `tasks.md`, with persistent IDs and retirement history. Failed identity reconciliation keeps the prior contract and warns. All portable writes pass redaction and scanning. Legacy plans without feature context retain the existing storage and execution path.

**CRITICAL: The plan command creates plans, it does NOT execute them by default.**

- **Save plan to `${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-plan.md`:**

```markdown
# Session Plan

**Created:** [timestamp]
**Intent Contract:** See [resolved OCTO_PLAN_DIR]/session-intent.md

## What You'll End Up With
[Clear description of deliverable]

## How We'll Get There

### Phase Weights
- Discover: [X]% - [Brief description]
- Define: [X]% - [Brief description]
- Develop: [X]% - [Brief description]
- Deliver: [X]% - [Brief description]

### Execution Commands
To execute this plan, run:
\`\`\`bash
/octo:embrace "[user's goal]"
\`\`\`

Or execute phases individually:
- `/octo:discover` (if Discover > 20%)
- `/octo:define` (if Define > 20%)
- `/octo:develop` (if Develop > 20%)
- `/octo:deliver` (if Deliver > 20%)

## Provider Requirements
[Render every provider from the retained PROVIDER_STATUS snapshot.]

## Success Criteria
[From intent contract]

## Next Steps
1. Review this plan
2. Adjust if needed (re-run /octo:plan)
3. Execute with /octo:embrace when ready
```

- **Display the plan to the user** (same visualization as before)

- **Show completion message with the resolved absolute path:**

```text
✅ Plan saved to [resolved OCTO_PLAN_DIR]/session-plan.md

To execute this plan, run:
  /octo:embrace "[user's goal]"

Or adjust the plan:
  /octo:plan  (re-run to modify)
```

### Step 6: Offer Next Actions (Optional Execution)

**Ask user what they want to do with the plan:**

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What would you like to do with this plan?",
      header: "Next Action",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Review and execute later", description: "Plan saved, I'll run /octo:embrace when ready (Recommended)"},
        {label: "Adjust plan weights", description: "Change phase emphasis before saving"},
        {label: "Execute now", description: "Run /octo:embrace immediately with this plan"},
        {label: "Multi-LLM debate the plan first", description: "Claude plus available external providers debate the plan's assumptions and risks before executing"},
        {label: "Different approach", description: "Suggest an alternative strategy"}
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

**If "Review and execute later":**
- Save plan and exit
- User can review `${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-plan.md` at their leisure
- User runs `/octo:embrace` when ready

**If "Adjust plan weights":**
- Ask which phases to emphasize/de-emphasize
- Regenerate plan visualization
- Save updated plan
- Return to Step 6 (ask again what to do)

**If "Execute now":**
- Read `${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/commands/embrace.md` and execute it with the user's goal
- Pass the intent contract and phase weights
- Let embrace workflow handle execution

**If "Multi-LLM debate the plan first":**
- Read `${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/commands/debate.md` and execute it with the plan as context (Claude plus available providers deliberate):
  - Topic: "Should we proceed with this plan? What are the risks and blind spots?"
  - `--rounds 2 --debate-style adversarial --context-file "${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-plan.md"`
- After the Multi-LLM debate completes, present the synthesis and return to Step 6
- If the debate confirms the plan, user can then select "Execute now"
- If the debate reveals issues, user can select "Adjust plan weights" or "Different approach"

**If "Different approach":**
- Ask what they'd prefer
- Regenerate from Step 3
- Return to Step 6 (ask again what to do)

### Step 7: Integration with /octo:embrace (Optional Execution)

**If user chose "Execute now" in Step 6:**

The plan command should load the explicit `/octo:embrace` command source, which handles:
- Execution of all 4 phases (Discover → Define → Develop → Deliver)
- Using the phase weights from the plan
- Referencing the intent contract
- Validation against success criteria
- Final reporting

**Important:** The plan command itself does NOT execute workflows. It delegates to `/octo:embrace` for execution.

### Step 8: Plan Command Completes

**The plan command exits after:**
- Creating and saving the plan (`${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-plan.md`)
- Creating the intent contract (`${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-intent.md`)
- Optionally loading `/octo:embrace` if user requested immediate execution

**The plan command does NOT:**
- Execute workflows directly (delegates to `/octo:embrace`)
- Validate results (that's `/octo:embrace`'s responsibility)
- Implement anything (that's what workflows do)

**Clear separation of concerns:**
- `/octo:plan` → Creates strategic plans
- `/octo:embrace` → Executes plans through 4-phase workflow
- Individual phase commands → Execute specific phases

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Research Mode

```
User: /octo:plan

[After 5 questions show research need]

Claude presents plan:
DISCOVER ████████████████████ 50%
DEFINE ██████ 15%
DEVELOP ████ 10%
DELIVER ██████████ 25%

"You'll get: Comprehensive research report with recommendations"

✅ Plan saved to /path/to/project/.octo/plans/plan-20260902T120000Z.a1b2c3/session-plan.md

To execute this plan, run:
  /octo:embrace "research topic X"

[Asks: "What would you like to do with this plan?"]
User selects: "Review and execute later"

→ Plan saved, user reviews it, runs /octo:embrace when ready
```

### Example 2: Build Mode with Immediate Execution

```
User: /octo:plan

[After 5 questions show build need with clear requirements]

Claude presents plan:
DISCOVER ████ 10%
DEFINE ██████ 15%
DEVELOP ████████████████ 40%
DELIVER ██████████████ 35%

"You'll get: Working implementation with tests"

[Asks: "What would you like to do with this plan?"]
User selects: "Execute now"

→ Invokes /octo:embrace immediately
→ Execution begins with saved plan and intent contract
```

### Example 3: Decision Mode

```
User: /octo:plan "Should we use Redis or PostgreSQL?"

[After 5 questions show decision need]

Claude presents plan:
→ Recommends /octo:debate for this type of decision

Plan saved with recommendation to use debate workflow

[Asks: "What would you like to do with this plan?"]
User selects: "Execute now"

→ Invokes /octo:debate instead of /octo:embrace
```

## Workflow Routing Table

| User Goal | Knowledge | Clarity | → Route To |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Research | Just starting | Vague | discover (heavy) |
| Research | Some familiarity | General | discover (moderate) → define |
| Decision | Well-informed | Clear | debate |
| Build | Expert | Fully specified | develop → deliver |
| Build | Some familiarity | General | embrace (all phases) |
| Review | Well-informed | Clear | review OR deliver |

---

## Integration with Intent Contract

The plan command is the primary entry point for creating intent contracts. It:

1. Captures comprehensive user intent
2. Creates `${OCTO_PLAN_DIR}/session-intent.md` (see Resolve Plan Storage Location)
3. Routes to appropriate workflows
4. Passes intent contract through execution
5. Validates outputs against original intent

This closes the loop between user intention and delivered results.

---

## Benefits

**For Users:**
- **Creates strategic plans** without automatic execution
- **Review before committing** - see the plan, adjust if needed
- **Execute when ready** - run `/octo:embrace` at your own pace
- **Intent contract** - captures goals and validates against them
- **Customized approach** - phase weights adapt to your situation
- **Clear separation** - planning vs. execution are distinct steps

**For Complex Tasks:**
- **Intelligent routing** - recommends best workflow based on context
- **Phase weighting** - optimizes effort distribution
- **Intent contract** - ensures alignment throughout execution
- **Flexible execution** - save plan, review, adjust, then execute

**Workflow Separation:**
- `/octo:plan` → Strategic planning (creates plans, doesn't execute)
- `/octo:embrace` → Execution (runs the full 4-phase workflow)
- Individual phases → Execute specific phases independently

---

**Ready to use!** Users can invoke with `/octo:plan` to create customized execution plans, then execute with `/octo:embrace` when ready.
