# Session Restoration

## Overview

Restore context from a previous session and seamlessly continue the workflow where you left off.

**Core principle:** Check state → Load adaptive context → Display restoration summary → Route to appropriate action.

---

## When to Use

**Use this skill when user says:**
- "Resume" or "continue working"
- "Pick up where I left off"
- "What was I doing?"
- "Restore session"
- "Continue from last time"

**Do NOT use for:**
- Starting new projects (use /octo:embrace)
- Checking current status only (use /octo:status)
- Modifying state directly (use octo-state.sh)

---

## The Process

### Phase 0: Check Session Handoff File (v9.6.0)

#### Step 0: Check for the session handoff file

Before checking `.octo/`, look for a session handoff file. This is written automatically
by PreCompact and SessionEnd hooks and contains a human-readable summary of the last session.
It lives beside the workflow state returned by `octopus state-path`, outside the project
checkout. Older releases wrote `.octo-continue.md` into the project root instead; read that
copy only when no relocated handoff exists, and never modify, move, or delete it.

```bash
HANDOFF_FILE=""
if WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE="$(octopus state-path)" && [[ -n "$WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE" ]]; then
    HANDOFF_FILE="$(dirname "$WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE")/continue.md"
fi
if [[ -n "$HANDOFF_FILE" && -f "$HANDOFF_FILE" ]]; then
    cat "$HANDOFF_FILE"
elif [[ -f ".octo-continue.md" ]]; then
    cat ".octo-continue.md"
fi
```

**If a handoff file was found**, display its contents to the user as context. Then continue
to Phase 1 to load the full state. The handoff file provides a quick overview; `.octo/STATE.md`
provides the authoritative state. If the legacy `.octo-continue.md` was shown, tell the user it
is no longer updated and can be deleted from the project.

### Phase 1: Check Project Initialization

## Repository feature recovery

Before looking for a transcript or machine-local `.octo` state, inspect portable feature artifacts:

```bash
OCTO_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin}"
python3 "$OCTO_ROOT/scripts/helpers/feature-contract.py" resume --root "$(pwd -P)" --explicit "<feature directory or spec path, empty when omitted>"
```

An unambiguous feature recovers intent, decisions, open markers and stable completed/pending task IDs from the repository. Historical completion is context and needs fresh verification. Missing raw runtime files are expected. If several unrelated features exist, ask the user to select one; never choose by recency. Pass the selected feature to the existing `agent-resume` orchestrator path. Explicit Claude agent IDs retain transcript continuation.

A feature with a spec only resumes planning. A feature with plan/tasks resumes pending implementation through the same policy, clarification, analysis and wave-validation gates. Run the returned decision batch once through the host's native question tool before the next plan/develop boundary. Keep skipped decisions open.

#### Step 1: Verify .octo/ Directory Exists

```bash
if [[ ! -d ".octo" ]]; then
    echo "No project state found"
    exit 1
fi
```

**If .octo/ does not exist but Step 0 found a handoff file**, display its contents and
offer to start a new session based on that context.

**If neither exists, display:**

```markdown
## Session Restoration Failed

**No project state found.**

There is no machine-local `.octo/` directory. Check the portable feature artifacts before treating this as a fresh project.

### Get Started

Run `/octo:embrace [your project description]` to start a new project.

**Example:**
```
/octo:embrace build a REST API with user authentication
```

This will:
1. Initialize .octo/ directory with STATE.md, PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md
2. Begin the Double Diamond workflow
3. Create session state you can resume later
```

**Stop here** - do not proceed to Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: Read Current State

#### Step 1: Execute octo-state.sh read_state

```bash
./scripts/octo-state.sh read_state
```

**Expected output format:**
```
schema=2.0
last_updated=2026-02-02T10:30:00Z
current_phase=2
current_position=define-requirements
status=in_progress
```

#### Step 2: Parse State Variables

Extract these key values:
- `current_phase` - Phase number (1-4)
- `current_position` - Description of current position within phase
- `status` - Workflow status (in_progress, blocked, complete, paused, etc.)
- `last_updated` - Timestamp of last state modification

---

### Phase 3: Load Adaptive Context

#### Step 1: Get Context Tier (Auto Mode)

```bash
./scripts/octo-state.sh get_context_tier auto
```

This automatically selects the appropriate context tier based on current status:

| Status | Tier Selected | Context Loaded |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| ready, planned, planning, complete, shipped | planning | STATE.md + PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md |
| building, in_progress | execution | + phase plans + recent summaries |
| blocked, paused | execution | + phase plans + recent summaries |

#### Step 2: Store Context for Reference

The context returned includes:
- Current state details
- Project vision and requirements
- Phase-specific plans and summaries
- Codebase analysis (if brownfield project)

---

### Phase 4: Extract History and Blockers

#### Step 1: Read Last 3 History Entries from STATE.md

```bash
# Extract history section from STATE.md
grep -A 4 "^## History" .octo/STATE.md | tail -n 3
```

**Expected format:**
```
- [2026-02-02T10:30:00Z] Phase 2: Completed requirements review (complete)
- [2026-02-02T09:15:00Z] Phase 2: Started define phase (in_progress)
- [2026-02-01T16:45:00Z] Phase 1: Completed discovery (complete)
```

#### Step 2: Extract Blockers from STATE.md

```bash
# Extract blockers section
sed -n '/^## Blockers/,/^## /p' .octo/STATE.md | head -n -1 | tail -n +2
```

**Expected format:**
- If blockers exist: List of blocker items
- If no blockers: `(none)`

#### Step 3: Read Project Title from PROJECT.md

```bash
# Get project title (first H1)
head -n 5 .octo/PROJECT.md | grep "^# " | head -1 | sed 's/^# //'
```

---

### Phase 5: Display Restoration Summary

#### Step 1: Build and Display Summary

```markdown
## Session Restored

**Project:** {project_title from PROJECT.md}
**Last Active:** {last_updated from STATE.md}
**Phase:** {current_phase} - {phase_name}
**Position:** {current_position}
**Status:** {status}

### Where You Left Off

{Last 3 entries from STATE.md history}

### Current Blockers

{Blockers from STATE.md or "None"}

### Ready to Continue

{Intelligent suggestion based on status - see routing table below}
```

#### Step 2: Map Phase Number to Name

| Phase | Name |
|-------|------|
| 1 | Discover |
| 2 | Define |
| 3 | Develop |
| 4 | Deliver |

---

### Phase 6: Intelligent Routing

#### Step 1: Route Based on Status

| Status | Action | Message |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `in_progress` | Continue current phase | "Continue with current phase. Context loaded." |
| `blocked` | Review blockers | "Review blockers first: `/octo:issues`" |
| `complete` | Ready for next phase | "Phase complete. Ready for `/octo:ship`" |
| `paused` | Resume project | "Project paused. Resume with `/octo:embrace`" |
| `ready` | Begin workflow | "Ready to begin. Run `/octo:embrace` to start." |
| `planning` | Continue planning | "Continue planning. Use `/octo:define` to refine." |
| `building` | Continue building | "Continue implementation. Use `/octo:develop`." |
| `shipped` | Project delivered | "Project delivered! Review lessons in LESSONS.md." |
| `complete_with_gaps` | Review gaps | "Phase complete with gaps. Review ISSUES.md before proceeding." |

#### Step 2: Phase-Specific Guidance (for in_progress status)

**Phase 1 (Discover):**
```
Continue research and exploration.
- Use `/octo:research [topic]` for multi-AI research
- Use `/octo:debate [question]` for decision support
- Check `.octo/phases/phase1/` for research notes
```

**Phase 2 (Define):**
```
Continue requirements clarification.
- Use `/octo:prd` to write product requirements
- Use `/octo:define` to refine scope
- Check `.octo/phases/phase2/` for requirements docs
```

**Phase 3 (Develop):**
```
Continue implementation.
- Use `/octo:develop` to build features
- Use `/octo:tdd` for test-driven development
- Check `.octo/phases/phase3/` for implementation plan
```

**Phase 4 (Deliver):**
```
Continue validation and delivery.
- Use `/octo:deliver` for final review
- Use `/octo:security` for security audit
- Use `/octo:ship` to finalize delivery
```

- [2026-01-27T10:00:00Z] Phase 1: Discovery complete (complete)

### Current Blockers

- Waiting for stakeholder availability

### Ready to Continue

Project paused. Resume with `/octo:embrace`

When ready to continue:
1. Review `.octo/PROJECT.md` for project context
2. Check `.octo/STATE.md` for pause reason
3. Run `/octo:embrace` to resume workflow
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use octo-state.sh for State Reading

**Good:**
```bash
./scripts/octo-state.sh read_state
./scripts/octo-state.sh get_context_tier auto
```

**Poor:**
```bash
# Parse STATE.md manually
grep "Current Phase" .octo/STATE.md
```

### 2. Provide Full Context Restoration

**Good:**
- Load adaptive context tier
- Show last 3 history entries
- Display any blockers
- Give phase-specific guidance

**Poor:**
- Only show current phase
- Ignore history
- No next steps

### 3. Route Intelligently Based on Status

**Good:**
```
Status: blocked → "Review blockers first: /octo:issues"
```

**Poor:**
```
Status: blocked → "Continue working"
```

---

## Red Flags - Don't Do This

| Action | Why It's Wrong |
|--------|----------------|
| Skip .octo/ existence check | Will fail with confusing errors |
| Ignore blockers on resume | User won't know why they stopped |
| Restart from beginning | Loses all previous context and progress |
| Skip history display | User loses continuity of what was done |
| Use hardcoded context tier | Should adapt based on current status |

---

## Integration with Other Skills

### With /octo:status

```
/octo:resume → Full restoration with context
/octo:status → Quick dashboard without restoration
```

### With /octo:embrace

```
No .octo/ exists → /octo:resume suggests /octo:embrace
.octo/ exists but paused → /octo:resume suggests resuming with /octo:embrace
```

### With flow-* skills

```
User runs /octo:resume
→ Context restored
→ User continues with /octo:develop (or appropriate phase skill)
```

---

## Quick Reference

| User Input | Action Required |
|------------|-----------------|
| "resume" | Resolve state with `octopus state-path` → Load context → Display summary → Route |
| "continue" | Same as resume |
| "pick up where I left off" | Same as resume |
| "what was I doing" | Same as resume, emphasize history |
| "restore session" | Same as resume |

---

## The Bottom Line

```
Run `octopus state-path` → Read state → Load adaptive context → Show history + blockers → Route intelligently
Otherwise → User loses previous context and wastes time re-discovering where they were
```

**Never restart from beginning if state exists. Restore context, show history, route intelligently.**

---

## Context Recovery After Compaction

When context is cleared (compaction, plan mode exit, new session), detect and reload automatically:

```bash
# Auto-detect context loss without writing into the project checkout.
# The plugin executable resolves its own installation root on every host.
if ! WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE="$(octopus state-path)" || [[ -z "$WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE" ]]; then
    echo "Unable to resolve persistent workflow state; refusing an incomplete resume." >&2
    exit 1
fi
if [[ -f "$WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE" ]] && [[ -z "${WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_LOADED}" ]]; then
    echo "⚠️  Context was cleared — reloading from persistent state..."
    NEEDS_RESUME=true
fi
```

**What survives context clearing:**
- Host-workspace project state (decisions, context, metrics; resolve with `octopus state-path`)
- `context/*.md` beside the path returned by `octopus state-path` (phase outputs)
- Native tasks (TaskList still works)
- Git commits and WIP checkpoints
- Multi-AI synthesis files in `~/.claude-octopus/results/`

After resume completes, set `export WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_LOADED=true` to prevent duplicate reloads.

**State persists in files. Context clearing is not a problem. Files outlive memory.**
